    "title": "Our Journey",
    "foundingVision": "Tusuka Group was established in 1995, and by 1997, it ventured into the garment business as a buying house named 'texel', initially focusing solely on the woven market. Recognizing the global demand for denim, Tusuka shifted its focus in 2001 to specialize in denim/jeans manufacturing.",
    "growthMilestones": "Starting with just 2 sewing lines and a small laundry in 2001, Tusuka expanded significantly. After a year of management recognizing the need for a large-world class in-house laundry section, the washing capacity and new sewing lines were expanded. Now, Tusuka boasts a washing capacity of 45,000 pieces per day and a total of 34 sewing lines dedicated to denim garment making.",
    "currentStance": "Today, Tusuka is dedicated to excellence in merchandising, product development, production, and logistics. The company has earned a reputation throughout the global apparel industry as one of the foremost factories in Bangladesh, recognized for its commitment to quality, timely delivery, and total value.
